Questions or comments, please email orbitjofficial@gmail.com or jpeter56@uic.edu.

To use the orbitJ code, simply download the latest orbitJ version and drag and drop it onto the FIJI/ImageJ toolbar to load the code, then press "run." See the demo video for a tutorial on how to use the program. 

In addition, a separate rotation tool is included in this repository if you would like to use it for other projects for image rotation.
